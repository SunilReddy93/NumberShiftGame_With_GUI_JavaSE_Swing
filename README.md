# NumberShiftGame_With_GUI_JavaSE_Swing
This is a number shifting game with GUI using Java Swing. This project/game has sound effects on every move that we make. This game has 500 moves.
The new and different thing in this project is its GUI.
I have tried to take it from console based game to Graphical User Interface based application using Java SE Swing.
